<h3><strong>What is Thiamine and Why is it Important?</strong></h3>
<p>Thiamine, or vitamin B1, is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for converting carbohydrates into energy. It also supports proper nerve function and plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. A deficiency in thiamine can lead to serious health conditions such as beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, highlighting the importance of adequate intake.</p>
<p>Thiamine is naturally found in foods like whole grains, legumes, nuts, and meat. However, with changing dietary habits and the rise of processed foods, thiamine deficiency has become a concern in certain populations. This has led to increased demand for thiamine supplements and fortified foods, driving growth in the thiamine market.</p>
