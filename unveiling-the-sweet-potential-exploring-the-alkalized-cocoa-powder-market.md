<h3><strong>What is Alkalized Cocoa Powder?</strong></h3>
<p>Alkalized cocoa powder, also known as Dutch-processed cocoa powder, is produced by treating cocoa beans with an alkaline solution. This process neutralizes the natural acidity of cocoa, resulting in a darker color, smoother flavor, and enhanced solubility. Unlike natural cocoa powder, which has a more intense and bitter taste, alkalized cocoa powder offers a milder, richer flavor profile, making it a favorite among chefs, bakers, and food manufacturers.</p>
