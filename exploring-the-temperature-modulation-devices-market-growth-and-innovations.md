<p><strong>What Are Temperature Modulation Devices?</strong><br />Temperature modulation devices are medical tools designed to regulate body temperature in patients, either by inducing hypothermia, maintaining normothermia, or managing hyperthermia. These devices are widely used in critical care settings, surgical procedures, and post-operative recovery to improve patient outcomes. Common applications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Hypothermia:</strong>&nbsp;Used to protect the brain and other organs during cardiac arrest, stroke, or traumatic brain injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fever Control:</strong>&nbsp;Managing elevated body temperatures in patients with infections or other conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surgical Support:</strong>&nbsp;Maintaining optimal body temperature during surgeries to prevent complications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Drivers of Market Growth</strong><br />The temperature modulation devices market is expanding rapidly, and several factors are contributing to this growth:</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>In August 2023,&nbsp;</strong>an agreement was formed by Attune Medical and Gentherm to distribute the one-time-use temperature control device ensoETM. By inserting this device into the esophagus and connecting it to an external heat exchanger such as the Blanketrol III, a closed-loop system for accurate temperature regulation for the patient is formed. Its location in the esophagus, close to the heart and surrounding blood veins, allows for incredibly effective heat transfer.</li>
