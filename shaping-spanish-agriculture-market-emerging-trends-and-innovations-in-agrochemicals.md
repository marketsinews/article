<li><strong>In April 2024,&nbsp;</strong>BASF has launched a new fungicide, Revyona&reg; (75g/L Mefentrifluconazole), for application on grape and fruit crops in Spain. European legislation regarding the renewal and registration of active substances and phytosanitary products is becoming increasingly stringent.
