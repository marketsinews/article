<p><strong>What Are Secondary Macronutrients?</strong><br />Secondary macronutrients are essential elements required by plants in relatively large quantities, though not as much as primary macronutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Calcium, magnesium, and sulfur are vital for various physiological processes in plants:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Calcium</strong>&nbsp;strengthens cell walls, improves root development, and enhances fruit quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Magnesium</strong>&nbsp;is a central component of chlorophyll, aiding in photosynthesis and energy production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sulfur</strong>&nbsp;is crucial for protein synthesis, enzyme activity, and overall plant vigor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While these nutrients are naturally present in soils, intensive farming practices, soil degradation, and imbalanced fertilizer use have led to widespread deficiencies, necessitating their supplementation.</p>
