<h3><strong>What is Sensor Fusion?</strong></h3>
<p>Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to produce more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive information than what could be achieved by using a single sensor. By integrating inputs from various sensors&mdash;such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS&mdash;sensor fusion algorithms can create a unified and enhanced understanding of the environment or system being monitored.</p>
<p>This technology is widely used in applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, smartphones, wearable devices, and industrial automation. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, sensor fusion enables the car to "see" its surroundings by combining data from cameras, LiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensors, ensuring safer and more efficient navigation.</p>
