<h3><strong>What is Cold Spray Coating?</strong></h3>
<p>Cold spray coating is a cutting-edge surface engineering technique that involves propelling fine powder particles at supersonic speeds onto a substrate. Unlike traditional thermal spray methods, cold spray operates at relatively low temperatures, preventing thermal degradation of the coating material and the substrate. This process results in dense, high-quality coatings with excellent adhesion and minimal porosity.</p>
<p>The technology is particularly valued for its ability to repair damaged components, enhance surface properties, and apply coatings to heat-sensitive materials. Its versatility has made it a preferred choice in industries ranging from aerospace and automotive to energy and healthcare.</p>
