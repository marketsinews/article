<h3><strong>What is Celtic Salt?</strong></h3>
<p>Celtic salt, also known as&nbsp;<strong>sel gris</strong>&nbsp;or gray salt, is a type of sea salt harvested from the coastal regions of France, particularly in the Gu&eacute;rande region. Unlike regular table salt, which is heavily processed and stripped of its natural minerals, Celtic salt is hand-harvested using traditional methods that preserve its rich mineral content. Its characteristic gray color comes from the clay-lined salt ponds where it is collected, and it retains trace minerals like magnesium, calcium, potassium, and iron.</p>
