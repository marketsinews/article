<h3>What is Drip Irrigation?</h3>
<p>Drip irrigation is a water-efficient method of delivering water directly to the roots of plants through a network of valves, pipes, tubing, and emitters. Unlike traditional irrigation methods that often lead to water wastage, drip irrigation ensures that water is used precisely where it&rsquo;s needed, minimizing evaporation and runoff. This method is particularly beneficial in regions facing water scarcity and for crops that require consistent moisture levels.</p>
