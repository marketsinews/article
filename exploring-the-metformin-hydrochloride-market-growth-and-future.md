<h3><strong>What is Metformin Hydrochloride?</strong></h3>
<p>Metformin Hydrochloride is an oral antihyperglycemic agent widely used to manage blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver, improving insulin sensitivity, and enhancing glucose uptake by muscles. Known for its efficacy, safety, and affordability, Metformin is often the first-line treatment recommended by healthcare professionals worldwide.</p>

This alarming increase in diabetes cases has directly contributed to the growing demand for Metformin Hydrochloride.</p>
